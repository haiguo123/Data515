            Connect the **Start Actor** to the **Target Actor** by hopping through movies and co-stars.

            **How to play**
            1. Start from the current actor.
            2. Choose a movie that the actor appeared in.
            3. Pick a co-star from that movie to become your next actor.
            4. Repeat until you reach the target actor.

            **Game modes**
            - **Normal Mode**: win in as **few steps** as possible (each move counts as 1 step).
            - **Challenge Mode**: win with the **lowest total box office** (each chosen movie adds its box office to your total).

            **🏆 Winning**
            You win as soon as your current actor matches the target actor. Your score is compared to the algorithm’s optimal path.
